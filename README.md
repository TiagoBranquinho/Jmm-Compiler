## Self-assesment

Taking into account all the constant and dedicated work of the group throughout the semester, as well as the excellent
grades obtained in the different checkpoints, we consider that the deserved grade is 19,5.

## Extras

In the server, the cp1 and cp2 scores are at 100%. The cpf score is at 98% (just failing the two register allocation
private tests). <br>
All public tests given pass, with only the exception of the public test referent to register allocation.
In Jasmin, instead of just the mandatory bigger comparaion (>), the bigger or equal comparation is done (>=). <br>
Both constant propagation and constant folding are implemented.
